I currently study M.Sc. Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Topics include interaction design, UX, XR, game design, and computer graphics â€“ which I have complemented with a focus on environmental and social aspects of technology.

I believe the creative process is just as valuable as the outcome, and that collaboration holds more meaning than competition. I love coming up with wild ideas and challenging assumptions, and I strive to design interactions that aren't just usable but _intrinsically joyful_.
