Trackfield is a running app for Android. It's my first venture into Android development, and so I have learnt a lot on the way. The problem is that it has taken _way_ too much time, and the lack of an MVP-strategy hasn't really been helpful in that regard.

It's kind of like Strava, and currently uses Strava's API. Which is a problem since now they disallow similar apps from using the API.

We'll see if I manage to complete the project some day.
