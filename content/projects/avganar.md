Avg책n채r is a Garmin Connect IQ widget displaying (public transport) nearby stops and departures within Stockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) in Sweden.

I started development in April 2021, and released it in November 2022. It's the first project I've released officially.

You can find it on [Github](https://github.com/felwal/avganar) and the [Connect IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-GB/apps/a96ddb52-3edd-4298-8348-5bd818376a2a).
