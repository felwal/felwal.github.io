## Lost in Translatopia

In this role-playing language-learner, the player explores different regions where they speak different languages – and helps humans reconnect with each other.

As help they are accompanied by a small friendly shoggoth called Shogpadre. (The lovecraftian monster that recently became a metaphor for LLMs.) Because sometimes the crazy ideas do make it through!

I was responsible for much of the coding, especially the dialog and quest systems:

## Permatotems

<p class="caption">Jun 2024 – Ongoing</p>

I'm currently working on a game blending totems with ideas from rewilding, Gaia theory, and permacomputing. Totems are animated by wilderness, and provide different rewilding capabilities. The player's goal is to develop and maintain a flourishing ecosystem.

After some months of ideation, I started sketching and made a quick working prototype. My challenge right now is to make the core gameplay loop balanced and engaging.

Exploring adjacent design spaces really does facilitate additional inspiration.

## 4D Labyrinth

Another experiment is this higher-dimensional variant of the classic board game. Playing requires hard thinking, and I've found it helps explain higher dimensions and gain intuition. I'm currently evaluating if I want to turn it into a board game or videogame – with better path visualisation and actions for rotating in 4D; wouldn't that be cool?

I also prototyped a 6D variant, but it turned out far too complex for satisfying gameplay.

## Hands-on math learning

<p class="caption">Apr – Dec 2019</p>

Game development has for me been a big help in learning math on an intuitive level. Flappy Bird helped me understand polynomials:

And family trees helped me with trigonometry and fractals:
