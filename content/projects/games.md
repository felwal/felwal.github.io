## Lost in Translatopia

In this role-playing language-learner, the player explores different regions where they speak different languages – and helps humans reconnect with each other.

As help they are accompanied by a small friendly shoggoth called Shogpadre. (The Lovecraftian monster that became a metaphor for LLMs.) Because sometimes the crazy ideas do make it through!

I was responsible for much of the coding, especially the dialogue and quest systems:

## Permatotems

{{< callout text="Jun 2024 – Ongoing" outline=true >}}

I'm currently working on a game blending totems with ideas from rewilding, Gaia theory, and permacomputing. Totems are animated by wilderness and provide different rewilding capabilities. The player's goal is to support a flourishing ecosystem.

After some months of ideation, I started sketching and made a quick working prototype. My challenge right now is to make the core gameplay loop balanced and engaging.

Exploring adjacent design spaces really does facilitate additional inspiration.

## 4D Labyrinth

{{< callout text="Jun 2023" outline=true >}}

Another experiment is this higher-dimensional variant of the classic board game. Playing requires some thinking, and I've found it helps explain higher dimensions and gain intuition. I also prototyped a 6D variant, but it turned out far too complex for satisfying gameplay.

I'm currently evaluating if I want to turn it into a board game or videogame – with better path visualisation and real hypercube rotation; wouldn't that be cool?
