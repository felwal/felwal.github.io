In order to win the player completes four puzzles, collecting the codes and keys required to open the door and escape.

### Tangibles

We used books as tangibles as they can be both handled with one hand and lay flat on a surface; the book cover can be used for image recognition; and most people have some at home. Interacting with the tangibles affects the AR environment.

### Meta puzzle

The Meta puzzle ties together all the other four puzzles with four locks. In accordance with the "open structure", they can be solved in any order:

{{< figrow >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-lock-1.png" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-structure.jpg" outline=true >}}
{{< /figrow >}}

The two code locks use AR buttons with screen touch as input, while the two padlocks require keys attached to tangibles:

{{< figrow force-row=true >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-lock-pin-1.png" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-lock-pin-2.png" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-lock-key-1.png" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-lock-key-2.png" >}}
{{< /figrow >}}

### Labyrinth puzzle

The labyrinth puzzle has the player tilting the book, getting the ball to the goal to receive a key:

{{< figrow force-row=true >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-gyro.png" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/escaperoom-gyro-2.png" >}}
{{< /figrow >}}

While the ball is rolling, a looping audio track is played as feedback, with its speed and pitch modified dynamically as a function of the rolling speed.

### Racing puzzle

And for the racing puzzle you rotate the book like a wheel, steering a remote-controlled car to collect the key. Gas is applied through a traditional UI touch button. Touch was chosen as it is ubiquitous and contrasts with the untraditional tangible, to make the combination easier.

## User evaluation

We performed a couple of think-aloud sessions coupled with interviews to evaluate the interactions and compare the different modalities.

### Analysis

I handled the analysis, which included coding:

Affinity diagramming:

And insights extraction:

### Findings

Here are our main insights:

- _multitasking modalities was difficult_: e.g. handling both a tangible and touchscreen
- _tangibles had unclear affordances_ â€“ but felt natural, immersive, and engaging once learnt
- _puzzle order affected learning_ of how to interact with untraditional modalities
