The Spotify Librarian is a personalised ape who helps you discover new music. It is inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld, and expands upon the metaphor of "Your Library".

### Problem

One problem we tried to tackle is users becoming disengaged over time, either due to repetitive recommendations or a lack of motivation to explore new music. The design also aims to make the Spotify experience a bit more personal.

### Ape Intelligence

I am a bit critical of the challenge starting with a specific technology (AI) rather than from an actual problem. I have tried to use the tactic of "designing affordances subversively"[^resistance] to blend in some critical ideas, going against the financial interests of using as much AI as possible for everything.

Because AI has costs. The design tries to challenge the cornucopian paradigm by being ephemeral, making some of the material costs visible, and possibly making the user reconsider if they really need AI-recommendations right now.[^cornucopia] I also think there is something we lose when being served everything we want all the time, automatic and perfectly tailored. The Librarian has a life of their own and doesn't only exist to please the user.

### Music bananas

The explicit signal used is feeding the Librarian with music bananas representing specific songs. This mechanism also couples with the implicit signal – the amount of electricity available on the power grid – which determines how easy or hard it is to pull down and sling the music banana.[^felt]

### Evolving taste and style

Feeding the Librarian affects their recommendations and look. Their taste is ephemeral: after a while their eaten music resets, and the style updates. The idea is to offer a more selective sandbox for music exploration. Librarian-recommended songs appear with the banana icon – in contrast to the (almost ideological) magic sparks.

In this prototype they are images generated by DALL-E, but I would prefer something much simpler and cheaper, generating maybe costumes etc. applied to a predefined model.

    {{< figure src="/images/librarian-playlist.png" >}}
{{< /figrow >}}

### Hunger

The more hungry the Librarian is, the less precise their recommendations become. If completely empty, they become completely _random_. This is a way to vary back and forth on the scale of boring–too risky, instead of trying to home in on the "perfect" amount. It also make possible recommendations of songs which might not fit into any category.[^monster]

### Shadow librarian

If the user instead feeds the Librarian too much, the recommendations instead flip to the _opposite_ of their learned taste. Here I use it to "punish" the user for spending too much electricity, yet it could at the same time help them discover music they never would have otherwise.

This is a playful take on the _Waluigi effect_: in teaching an AI model "good behavior", it also implicitly learns "bad behaviour" – and thus it becomes possible to draw out this disagreeable shadow version.

The transformation can be seen as a "monster", a result of modernist over-optimism about technology, right now especially AI.[^monster] Shadow or random recommendations might also be considered a kind of breakdown, putting the user out of auto-pilot mode.[^experience] Usability is only one of many values we can design for, and here I focussed more on creating playful aesthetic experiences.

### Your Librarian found a friend!

Sometimes the Librarian ventures out into cyberspace and finds friends with similar taste. These are temporary and change when the taste changes, and their users are anonymous. This is to give it a more playful and less serious air, and have a semi-social feature that is consequential.

### Hold the door!

During the crit we got the feedback that it would be nice to be able to turn the Librarian off, in case the user just wants to listen to their own music. Here I implemented that with the door icon: close it to only get Librarian recommendations within that specific playlist, and open to get in other playlists as well.

    {{< figure src="/images/librarian-options-cut.png" >}}
{{< /figrow >}}

### Navigation

The user can find their Librarian-related playlists in the "Made for You" category. I don't think this is perfect, as I would like them somewhere in the Library tab. However, I think rather that Spotify should move the whole category.

{{< /figrow >}}

## Process

We started out with mapping how users currently discover new music, and then continued with HMWs and brainstorming:

After settling on and fleshing out an idea, we made a quick low-fi prototype:
